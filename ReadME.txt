This application's purpose is to sort good on a website from bad news. Of course, the risk here is creating an echo chamber where 
you only hear what you want to hear but haven't we had enough of hearing what's terrible in the world? 
Let's just have a go at doing something positive. 

The idea is I get a dataset of headline that are classified as either good news or bad news. I guess neutral could work but it doesn't really matter. 
Neutral should be considered good because at least it isn't bad. 

How much training data do I need? 

My challenge is to have this up and running by the end of today.
